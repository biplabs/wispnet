# Browser gateway security and compatibility (#10)

## v1 decision

The shared Rust Android/desktop gateway serves **HTTP only on IPv4 loopback**.
Each client installation saves one readable address such as
`desktop-183296aa35df-llama.localhost:<port>` per pinned system and service.
Names contain a lowercase system slug, the first 12 hexadecimal characters of
its host ID, and a service slug. Collisions receive a saved numeric suffix
(`-2`, `-3`). Saved names survive display-name changes and reconnect order.
Opening a service with an older address replaces its name without keeping an alias;
the reserved port stays unchanged. Open returns the stable root URL, with no capability
in its path, query or fragment. Repeated opens reuse the listener; going online
restores saved listeners on exactly their original ports. A conflicting local
port fails explicitly rather than silently changing a bookmark. Addresses are
saved in owner-only `browser-routes.json`, bound to the installation identity;
browser credentials are never persisted in this file.

Native Android and Linux apps resolve URLs through the [shared registry](service-registry.md)
and call them directly using device-level access. No API access token, per-app
consent or credential renewal is required. Websites must have an exact allowed
origin configured on the device; unauthorized website requests are rejected
before forwarding, including simple POSTs and opaque/malformed origins. A service's
own Authorization/API-key requirements remain unchanged. Host revocation still
terminates access. Browser navigation retains its separate session-cookie and
single-use handoff behavior. Native apps share the device's trust boundary.

There is no ten-minute route or cookie deadline. Going offline and process death
close sockets; going online restores the same addresses. Network changes cancel
in-flight requests without replay, restore listeners, and rotate credentials.
Each request checks current local service state or uses an authenticated peer
connection whose host checks grants and service incarnation. Removing the local
peer pin also denies forwarding. Explicitly opening a recreated service adopts
its new incarnation at the same address; stale bindings stay denied.

A browser address-bar, bookmark or app navigation (`Sec-Fetch-Site: none`,
`Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate`, `Sec-Fetch-Dest: document`, GET without Origin) can
establish a host-only HttpOnly SameSite=Strict session cookie and is redirected
to the same path. Missing or stale cookies on fetches, frames, cross-site links,
and unsafe methods cannot establish sessions. Cookies rotate when listeners are
restored, but the address does not. This cookie is a browser session cookie,
without Secure or a timed Max-Age; authorization still happens per request.

The trust boundary excludes hostile same-UID/root processes and application
scripts accessing their own origin. A browser secure-context flag does not
establish transport encryption; Iroh encrypts the peer transport.

Applications requiring HTTPS-specific cookie semantics are unsupported in v1.
A response setting Secure, Partitioned, SameSite=None or `__Host-`, `__Secure-`,
`__Http-` (including `__Host-Http-`) cookies is rejected with 502 **before any
upstream headers are emitted**. Those flags/prefixes are never stripped to make
a login appear to work. Ordinary application cookies retain their Path,
HttpOnly and SameSite settings, lose Domain to become host-only, and cannot set
or receive `_wispnet_session`. This is a bounded compatibility decision, not a
claim that arbitrary web apps work over HTTP.

Service workers are unsupported: script requests with `Service-Worker` or
`Sec-Fetch-Dest: serviceworker` get 403 before connecting to the backend.
`Service-Worker-Allowed` is removed from upstream responses. Origins persist for
the same logical system/service, including explicit backend
replacement. Application cookies and localStorage therefore persist at that
origin; offline does not erase rendered pages, downloaded data or application
storage. A different system or service gets a separate hostname and port.
Own-origin scripts remain application code trusted with that application's access.

Relative and same-gateway-origin redirects work. Owner-local absolute redirects
to the **exact current backend origin** are rewritten to the gateway origin.
Remote private backend addresses are intentionally not disclosed in catalogs;
such absolute redirects cannot be safely rewritten and are rejected. Other
origins/schemes, userinfo, backslashes, control characters and Refresh redirects
are rejected with 502. External OAuth/SSO and application-embedded absolute URLs
need an explicit future compatibility design. Applications should use relative
URLs. Ordinary relative fixture login passes in Chromium and Firefox.

## HTTP boundary

- Exact Host, single Origin and Fetch Metadata are checked before backend access.
  Cross-site/sibling/null-origin requests are rejected, including GET and
  WebSocket. Non-GET/HEAD requests and WebSocket require exact same-origin Origin.
  Only direct user navigation can mint a session; external cross-site navigation
  and missing app handoff tokens grant no access.
- Browser-facing requests must be HTTP/1.1 origin-form. GET/HEAD/POST/PUT/PATCH/
  DELETE/OPTIONS are supported; TRACE/CONNECT and other methods get 405.
  Uploads require a single decimal Content-Length (zero if absent), at most
  16 MiB, within 30 seconds. Chunked uploads, Expect/TE/Trailer and ambiguous
  framing get 400; oversize declared uploads get 413.
- Headers are bounded to 32 KiB/96 fields and a **total** ten-second deadline,
  not a per-byte idle timeout. The gateway allows 16 routes and 32 concurrent
  accepted connections across routes; excess connections close immediately.
  Stop releases active socket capacity. A slow reader applies bounded-copy backpressure;
  there is no whole-response buffer and no total download-size cap.
- HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 backend responses support exact Content-Length,
  close-delimited bodies and plain chunked transfer. Chunk lines are at most
  128 bytes; each chunk is at most 16 MiB; extensions/trailers are unsupported.
  Duplicate/conflicting Content-Length/Transfer-Encoding and unsupported 1xx
  responses get 502. Fixed-length/chunked termination prevents copying a second
  response. Malformed bodies after headers abort the connection; they cannot
  be converted retrospectively into a 502.
- WebSocket requires GET, version 13, a base64 16-byte key, Connection/Upgrade,
  exact Origin and a valid 101/Sec-WebSocket-Accept response. A returned
  subprotocol must have been offered. Non-WebSocket protocol upgrades are
  unsupported. Validated connections stream bidirectionally with backpressure.
- Request forwarding credentials/proxy headers and response hop-by-hop headers
  (including Connection-nominated fields) are removed. Upstream CORS permission
  headers cannot relax the gateway boundary. Responses force no-store,
  no-referrer, frame-ancestors 'none', X-Frame-Options DENY, same-origin CORP/COOP.
  Application CSP headers are retained alongside the frame restriction.
- Peer identity/service incarnation and current host-local grants select the
  backend; catalog display text never selects a URL/backend. Revocation/removal
  cancels active native streams. Owner-local binding changes are polled every
  second with a one-second storage-read deadline. No HTTP write is retried or
  replayed automatically after interruption/reconnect.

## Recorded 2026-10-17 validation

`scripts/test_physical_gateway_security.py` exercises the installed shared Rust
node on CachyOS/KDE and Ubuntu 24.04 `desktop.home` in **both directions**, with
two temporary same-ID services and malicious literal display text. Chromium
154.0.8037.97 locally and existing Firefox 158.0 in headless mode on Ubuntu each
open simultaneous owner-local and remote origins. Checks cover application and
HttpOnly credential cookies, localStorage, relative login, chunked SSE,
WebSocket echo, denied cross-origin fetch/WebSocket/iframe GET/form POST with **zero backend requests**, rejected Secure/prefix
cookies/external redirects and blocked service-worker registration. Raw checks
cover CSRF, null/cross-site Origin, Host mismatch, methods, framing, upload
bounds, bootstrap replay and actual non-loopback interface connection refusal.
Host-local grant withdrawal denies an existing route, remains denied after
client-node restart, and permits a fresh explicit Open after regrant.
An interrupted application POST commits exactly once; a fresh Open does not
replay it. Fixtures restore services/grants/pins/access settings; the relay PID
is unchanged and the remote Qt/tray unit remains absent.

Historical checks before persistent URLs: the seven `wispnet-client` gateway unit tests also ran as a native executable on
headless Ubuntu: strict request/response/cookie/redirect/WebSocket cases;
single-use bootstrap and Stop; short **private test-only** expiry limits and
forced exact port reuse by a different peer; 16-route/32-socket limits and a
continuously trickled header stopped by the ten-second deadline. Expired tokens
and old cookies/Host cannot substitute the newly bound host; fresh bootstrap
gets a different credential. No production TTL control is exposed. This is
same-code expiry validation, not a claim of waiting out a physical ten-minute
browser session. Existing [service recreation](service-lifecycle.md) and
[offline/restart](linux-desktop.md) evidence remains independently scoped.

Run the opt-in physical test only on those approved paired hosts:

```sh
python3 scripts/test_physical_gateway_security.py
python3 scripts/test_physical_service_recreation.py
cargo test -p wispnet-client --lib --locked
```

The enabled `scripts/test.sh` pre-push suite also checks native tunnel SSE early
arrival, slow-reader backpressure/cancellation, bounded QUIC/connection/stream
credit, malformed frames/timeouts, host policy isolation, and no POST replay
(`crates/agent/tests/service_tunnel.rs`, `scripts/tunnel_smoke.py`). These are
consolidated with remaining final-device work in [release acceptance](release-acceptance.md)
and #14. Actual independent relay VM/disk replacement remains #18; this
checkpoint neither destroys the live relay nor claims that deployment test.
The native `explicit_tls_relay_without_udp_pins_identity_enforces_grants_and_recovers`
fixture runs locally and as an executable on headless Ubuntu: rebuilds its own
stateless TLS relay at the same address, recovers an approved client within the
30-second test bound without replaying a service request, restarts a previously
revoked client with the same key, and denies both its catalog and bound service
request. This checks the authority boundary across relay replacement; it does
not establish cloud provisioning or changed-IP VM/disk replacement acceptance.
Fresh Play-phone browser acceptance is separate from Android app/instrumentation
APK build success.

and [service-worker script requests](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#service-worker-script-request).

Android Chrome may classify app-to-browser intents as cross-site. Explicit Open
therefore also issues a separate `launch_url` with a one-use, 60-second fragment
token. Its isolated landing page exchanges that token for the same session cookie,
then navigates to the stable root URL. Tokens are bounded, never stored on disk,
and do not impose a lifetime on a service address or authenticated session.
Desktop browsers can open the stable root directly. Bookmarks retain the root URL.

## Persistent URL regression coverage

Current native regressions check stable deduplicated addresses, exact-port restoration
after client recreation, port conflict failure, credential rotation, cross-origin
and iframe denial, missing cookies, service isolation, local policy withdrawal on
an existing route, and continued access after advancing past the old ten-minute
boundary. Header and aggregate socket limits remain bounded. The Android optional
`--persistent-session` acceptance run streams for more than ten minutes and checks
that the same address and credential still work; it replaces the old expiry test.

## Device-level HTTP API

The [shared service registry](service-registry.md) uses the device's host/service
grants without per-app consent or API access tokens. Approved website origins
can call service APIs directly; other website requests are blocked before reaching
the backend. Upstream CORS headers remain stripped; the gateway generates its own
approved-origin headers. The registry and service listeners remain loopback-only,
reject unexpected Host headers, and expose no management operations. Ports are
configurable, with stable saved addresses and explicit conflict errors.
